User authentication is a vital feature of applications
Websites use session cookies to track your progress on the server so it knows what to do next
We can use session cookies to get our application to remember a user so it can display user-specific 
information/restricted data, etc
User authentication can be as easy as matching a password to a stored string, but that invites a huge security vulnerability
Most web frameworks do not have built-in encryption, but there are many libraries and packages that will easily 
encrypt passwords for you. Ruby has a gem for encryption called BCrypt
With encryption, passwords are converted into nonsense hashes that are not reversible so hackers have a much harder 
time figuring out passwords and matching them with users

Applications
Integrate web apps with user auth
Use user sessions to restrict access to certain pages
